# Hoardable ![gem version](https://img.shields.io/gem/v/hoardable?style=flat-square)

Hoardable is an ActiveRecord extension for Ruby 2.6+, Rails 6.1+, and PostgreSQL that allows for versioning
and soft-deletion of records through the use of _uni-temporal inherited tables_.

[Temporal tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_database) are a database design pattern where each
row of a table contains data along with one or more time ranges. In the case of this gem, each database row
has a time range that represents the rowâ€™s valid time range - hence "uni-temporal".

[Table inheritance](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/ddl-inherit.html) is a feature of PostgreSQL that
allows a table to inherit all columns of a parent table. The descendant tableâ€™s schema will stay in sync with
its parent. If a new column is added to or removed from the parent, the schema change is reflected on its
descendants.

With these concepts combined, `hoardable` offers a simple and effective model versioning system for Rails.
Versions of records are stored in separate, inherited tables along with their valid time ranges and
contextual data. Compared to other Rails-oriented versioning systems, this gem strives to be more explicit
and obvious on the lower database level, while still familiar and convenient to use within Ruby on Rails.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'hoardable'
```

Run `bundle install`, and then run:

```
bin/rails g hoardable:install
bin/rails db:migrate
```

This will generate PostgreSQL functions, an initiailzer, and set `config.active_record.schema_format = :sql`
in `application.rb`.

### Model Installation

You must include `Hoardable::Model` into an ActiveRecord model that you would like to hoard versions of:

```ruby
class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  include Hoardable::Model
  ...
end
```

Then, run the generator command to create a database migration and migrate it:

```
bin/rails g hoardable:migration Post
bin/rails db:migrate
```

By default, it will guess the foreign key type for the `_versions` table based on the primary key of the
model specified in the migration generator above. If you want/need to specify this explicitly, you can do so:

```
bin/rails g hoardable:migration Post --foreign-key-type uuid
```

_Note:_ Creating an inherited table does not inherit the indexes from the parent table. If you need to query
versions often, you should add appropriate indexes to the `_versions` tables.

## Usage

### Overview

Once you include `Hoardable::Model` into a model, it will dynamically generate a "Version" subclass of that
model. As we continue our example from above:

```ruby
Post #=> Post(id: integer, created_at: datetime, updated_at: datetime, hoardable_id: integer)
PostVersion #=> PostVersion(id: integer, created_at: datetime, updated_at: datetime, hoardable_id: integer, _data: jsonb, _during: tsrange, _event_uuid: uuid, _operation: enum)
Post.version_class #=> same as `PostVersion`
```

A `Post` now `has_many :versions`. With the default configuration, whenever an update and deletion of a
`Post` occurs, a version is created:

```ruby
post = Post.create!(title: "Title")
post.versions.size # => 0
post.update!(title: "Revised Title")
post.reload.versions.size # => 1
post.versions.first.title # => "Title"
post.destroy!
post.trashed? # true
post.versions.size # => 2
Post.find(post.id) # raises ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound
```

Each `PostVersion` has access to the same attributes, relationships, and other model behavior that
`Post` has, but as a read-only record:

``` ruby
post.versions.last.update!(title: "Rewrite history") #=> raises ActiveRecord::ReadOnlyRecord
```

If you ever need to revert to a specific version, you can call `version.revert!` on it.

```ruby
post = Post.create!(title: "Title")
post.update!(title: "Whoops")
post.reload.versions.last.revert!
post.title # => "Title"
```

If you would like to untrash a specific version of a record you deleted, you can call `version.untrash!` on
it. This will re-insert the model in the parent classâ€™s table with the original primary key.

```ruby
post = Post.create!(title: "Title")
post.id # => 1
post.destroy!
post.versions.size # => 1
Post.find(post.id) # raises ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound
trashed_post = post.versions.trashed.last
trashed_post.id # => 2
trashed_post.untrash!
Post.find(post.id) # #<Post>
```

_Note:_ You will notice above that both `posts` and `post_versions` pull from the same ID sequence. This
allows for uniquely identifying source records and versions when results are mixed together. Both a source
record and versions have an automatically managed `hoardable_id` that always represents the primary key value
of the original source record.

### Querying and Temporal Lookup

Since a `PostVersion` is an `ActiveRecord` class, you can query them like another model resource:

```ruby
post.versions.where(state: :draft)
```

If you want to look-up the version of a record at a specific time, you can use the `.at` method:

```ruby
post.at(1.day.ago) # => #<PostVersion>
# or you can use the scope on the version model class
post.versions.at(1.day.ago) # => #<PostVersion>
PostVersion.at(1.day.ago).find_by(hoardable_id: post.id) # => same as above
```

The source model class also has an `.at` method:

```ruby
Post.at(1.day.ago) # => [#<Post>, #<Post>]
```

This will return an ActiveRecord scoped query of all `Post` and `PostVersion` records that were valid at that
time, all cast as instances of `Post`.

There is also an `at` method on `Hoardable` itself for more complex and experimental temporal resource
querying. See [Relationships](#relationships) for more.

By default, `hoardable` will keep copies of records you have destroyed. You can query them specifically with:

```ruby
PostVersion.trashed
Post.version_class.trashed # <- same as above
```

_Note:_ A `Version` is not created upon initial parent model creation. To accurately track the beginning of
the first temporal period, you will need to ensure the source model table has a `created_at` timestamp
column. If this is missing, an error will be raised.

### Tracking Contextual Data

Youâ€™ll often want to track contextual data about the creation of a version. There are 2 options that can be
provided for tracking contextual information:

- `:whodunit` - an identifier for who is responsible for creating the version
- `:meta` - any other contextual information youâ€™d like to store along with the version

This information is stored in a `jsonb` column. Each keyâ€™s value can be in the format of your choosing.

One convenient way to assign contextual data to these is by defining a proc in an initializer, i.e.:

```ruby
# config/initializers/hoardable.rb
Hoardable.whodunit = -> { Current.user&.id }

# somewhere in your app code
Current.user = User.find(123)
post.update!(status: 'live')
post.reload.versions.last.hoardable_whodunit # => 123
```

You can also set this context manually as well:

```ruby
Hoardable.meta = { note: "reverting due to accidental deletion" }
post.update!(title: "Weâ€™re back!")
Hoardable.meta = nil
post.reload.versions.last.hoardable_meta['note'] # => "reverting due to accidental deletion"
```

A more useful pattern however is to use `Hoardable.with` to set the context around a block. For example, you
could have the following in your `ApplicationController`:

```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  around_action :use_hoardable_context

  private

  def use_hoardable_context
    Hoardable.with(whodunit: current_user.id, meta: { request_uuid: request.uuid }) do
      yield
    end
    # `Hoardable.whodunit` and `Hoardable.meta` are back to nil or their previously set values
  end
end
```

`hoardable` will also automatically capture the ActiveRecord
[changes](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveModel/Dirty.html#method-i-changes) hash, the `operation`
that cause the version (`update` or `delete`), and it will also tag all versions created in the same database
transaction with a shared and unique `event_uuid` for that transaction. These are available as:

```ruby
version.changes
version.hoardable_operation
version.hoardable_event_uuid
```

### Model Callbacks

Sometimes you might want to do something with a version after it gets inserted to the database. You can
access it in `after_versioned` callbacks on the source record as `hoardable_version`. These happen within
`ActiveRecord`â€™s `.save`, which is enclosed in an ActiveRecord transaction.

There are also `after_reverted` and `after_untrashed` callbacks available as well, which are called on the
source record after a version is reverted or untrashed.

```ruby
class User
  include Hoardable::Model
  after_versioned :track_versioned_event
  after_reverted :track_reverted_event
  after_untrashed :track_untrashed_event

  private

  def track_versioned_event
    track_event(:user_versioned, hoardable_version)
  end

  def track_reverted_event
    track_event(:user_reverted, self)
  end

  def track_untrashed_event
    track_event(:user_untrashed, self)
  end
end
```

### Configuration

The configurable options are:

```ruby
Hoardable.enabled # => default true
Hoardable.version_updates # => default true
Hoardable.save_trash # => default true
```

`Hoardable.enabled` globally controls whether versions will be ever be created.

`Hoardable.version_updates` globally controls whether versions get created on record updates.

`Hoardable.save_trash` globally controls whether to create versions upon record deletion. When this is set to
`false`, all versions of a record will be deleted when the record is destroyed.

If you would like to temporarily set a config setting, you can use `Hoardable.with`:

```ruby
Hoardable.with(enabled: false) do
  post.update!(title: 'unimportant change to create version for')
end
```

You can also configure these settings per `ActiveRecord` class using `hoardable_config`:

```ruby
class Comment < ActiveRecord::Base
  include Hoardable::Model
  hoardable_config version_updates: false
end
```

If you want to temporarily set the `hoardable_config` for a specific model, you can use
`with_hoardable_config`:

```ruby
Comment.with_hoardable_config(version_updates: true) do
  comment.update!(text: "Edited")
end
```

If a model-level option exists, it will use that. Otherwise, it will fall back to the global `Hoardable`
config.

## Relationships

### Belongs To Trashable

Sometimes youâ€™ll have a record that belongs to a parent record that youâ€™ll trash. Now the child recordâ€™s
foreign key will point to the non-existent trashed version of the parent. If you would like to have
`belongs_to` resolve to the trashed parent model in this case, you can give it the option of `trashable:
true`:

```ruby
class Comment
  include Hoardable::Associations # <- This includes is not required if this model already includes `Hoardable::Model`
  belongs_to :post, trashable: true
end
```

### Hoardable Has Many & Has One

Sometimes you'll have a Hoardable record that `has_one` or `has_many` other Hoardable records and you will
want to know the state of both the parent record and the children at a cetain point in time. You accomplish
this by adding `hoardable: true` to the `has_many` relationship and using the `Hoardable.at` method:

```ruby
class Post
  include Hoardable::Model
  has_many :comments, hoardable: true
end

def Comment
  include Hoardable::Model
end

post = Post.create!(title: 'Title')
comment1 = post.comments.create!(body: 'Comment')
comment2 = post.comments.create!(body: 'Comment')
datetime = DateTime.current
comment2.destroy!
post.update!(title: 'New Title')
post_id = post.id # 1

Hoardable.at(datetime) do
  post = Post.find(post_id)
  post.title # => 'Title'
  post.comments.size # => 2
  post.id # => 2
  post.version? # => true
  post.hoardable_id # => 1
end
```

There are some additional details to point out above. Firstly, it is important to note that the final
`post.id` yields a different value than the originally created `Post`. This is because the `post` within the
`#at` block is actually a temporal version, since it has been subsequently updated, but is reified as a
`Post` for the purposes of your business logic (serialization, rendering views, exporting, etc). Donâ€™t fret -
you will not be able to commit any updates to the version, even though it is masquerading as a `Post` because
a database trigger wonâ€™t allow you to.

If you are ever unsure if a Hoardable record is a source record or a version, you can be sure by calling
`version?` on it. If you want to get the true original source record ID, you can call `hoardable_id`.

_Note:_ `Hoardable.at` is still very experimental and is potentially not very performant for querying large
data sets.

### Cascading Untrashing

Sometimes youâ€™ll trash something that `has_many :children, dependent: :destroy` and if you untrash the parent
record, youâ€™ll want to also untrash the children. Whenever a hoardable version is created in a database
transaction, it will create or re-use a unique event UUID for the current database transaction and tag all
versions created with it. That way, when you `untrash!` a record, you could find and `untrash!` records that
were trashed with it:

```ruby
class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  include Hoardable::Model
  has_many :comments, hoardable: true, dependent: :destroy # `Comment` also includes `Hoardable::Model`

  after_untrashed do
    Comment
      .version_class
      .trashed
      .with_hoardable_event_uuid(hoardable_event_uuid)
      .find_each(&:untrash!)
  end
end
```

### Action Text

Hoardable provides support for ActiveRecord models with `has_rich_text`. First, you must create a temporal
table for `ActionText::RichText`:

```
bin/rails g hoardable:migration ActionText::RichText
bin/rails db:migrate
```

Then in your model include `Hoardable::Model` and provide the `hoardable: true` keyword to `has_rich_text`:

```ruby
class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  include Hoardable::Model # or `Hoardable::Associations` if you don't need `PostVersion`
  has_rich_text :content, hoardable: true
end
```

Now the `rich_text_content` relationship will be managed as a Hoardable `has_one` relationship:

```ruby
post = Post.create!(content: '<div>Hello World</div>')
datetime = DateTime.current
post.update!(content: '<div>Goodbye Cruel World</div>')
post.content.versions.size # => 1
post.content.to_plain_text # => 'Goodbye Cruel World'
Hoardable.at(datetime) do
  post.content.to_plain_text # => 'Hello World'
end
```

## Known Gotchas

### Rails Fixtures

Rails uses a method called
[`disable_referential_integrity`](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/06e9fbd954ab113108a7982357553fdef285bff1/activerecord/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/postgresql/referential_integrity.rb#L7)
when inserting fixtures into the database. This disables PostgreSQL triggers, which Hoardable relies on for
assigning `hoardable_id` from the primary keyâ€™s value. If you would still like to use fixtures, you must
specify the primary keyâ€™s value and `hoardable_id` to the same identifier value in the fixture. This is not
an issue with fixture replacement libraries like `factory_bot` or
[`world_factory`](https://github.com/FutureProofRetail/world_factory) however.

## Gem Comparison

#### [`paper_trail`](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail)

`paper_trail` is maybe the most popular and fully featured gem in this space. It works for other database
types than PostgeSQL and (by default) stores all versions of all versioned models in a single `versions`
table. It stores changes in a `text`, `json`, or `jsonb` column. In order to efficiently query the `versions`
table, a `jsonb` column should be used, which takes up a lot of space to index. Unless you customize your
configuration, all `versions` for all models types are in the same table which is inefficient if you are only
interested in querying versions of a single model. By contrast, `hoardable` stores versions in smaller,
isolated and inherited tables with the same database columns as their parents, which are more efficient for
querying as well as auditing for truncating and dropping. The concept of a `temporal` time-frame does not
exist for a single version since there is only a `created_at` timestamp.

#### [`audited`](https://github.com/collectiveidea/audited)

`audited` works in a similar manner as `paper_trail`. It stores all versions for all model types in a single
table, you must opt into using `jsonb` as the column type to store "changes", in case you want to query them,
and there is no concept of a `temporal` time-frame for a single version. It makes opinionated decisions about
contextual data requirements and stores them as top level data types on the `audited` table.

#### [`discard`](https://github.com/jhawthorn/discard)

`discard` only covers soft-deletion. The act of "soft deleting" a record is only captured through the
time-stamping of a `discarded_at` column on the records table; there is no other capturing of the event that
caused the soft deletion unless you implement it yourself. Once the "discarded" record is restored, the
previous "discarded" awareness is lost. Since "discarded" records exist in the same table as "undiscarded"
records, you must explicitly omit the discarded records from queries across your app to keep them from
leaking in.

#### [`paranoia`](https://github.com/rubysherpas/paranoia)

`paranoia` also only covers soft-deletion. In their README, they recommend using `discard` instead of
`paranoia` because of the fact they override ActiveRecordâ€™s `delete` and `destroy` methods. `hoardable`
employs callbacks to create trashed versions instead of overriding methods. Otherwise, `paranoia` works
similarly to `discard` in that it keeps deleted records in the same table and tags them with a `deleted_at`
timestamp. No other information about the soft-deletion event is stored.

#### [`logidze`](https://github.com/palkan/logidze)

`logidze` is an interesting versioning alternative that leverages the power of PostgreSQL triggers. Instead
of storing the previous versions or changes in a separate table, it stores them in a proprietary JSON format
directly on the database row of the record itself. If does not support soft deletion.
