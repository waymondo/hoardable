## [Unreleased]

- Stability is coming.

## [0.7.0] - 2022-09-29

- **Breaking Change** - Continuing along with the change below, the `foreign_key` on the `_versions`
  tables is now changed to `hoardable_source_id` instead of the i18n model name dervied foreign key.
  The intent is to never leave room for conflict of foreign keys for existing relationships. This
  can be resolved by renaming the foreign key columns from their i18n model name derived column
  names to `hoardable_source_id`, i.e. `rename_column :post_versions, :post_id, :hoardable_source_id`.

## [0.6.0] - 2022-09-28

- **Breaking Change** - Previously, a source model would `has_many :versions` with an inverse
  relationship based on the i18n interpreted name of the source model. Now it simply `has_many
  :versions, inverse_of :hoardable_source` to not potentially conflict with previously existing
  relationships.

## [0.5.0] - 2022-09-25

- **Breaking Change** - Untrashing a version will now insert a version for the untrash event with
  it's own temporal timespan. This simplifies the ability to query versions temporarily for when
  they were trashed or not. This changes, but corrects, temporal query results using `.at`.

- **Breaking Change** - Because of the above, a new operation enum value of "insert" was added. If
  you already have the `hoardable_operation` enum in your PostgreSQL schema, you can add it by
  executing the following SQL in a new migration: `ALTER TYPE hoardable_operation ADD VALUE
  'insert';`.

## [0.4.0] - 2022-09-24

- **Breaking Change** - Trashed versions now pull from the same postgres sequenced used by the
  source modelâ€™s table.

## [0.1.0] - 2022-07-23

- Initial release
